Though the basic machinery envisaged by this project is intended to contribute to the use of formal deduction, in its present state, it is oriented to facilitating and exploiting the advancement towards deductive machine intelligence.

First let me explain how I am using this term 'deductive intelligence'.

There was a time, many decades ago, when first-order theorem proving was the dominant paradigm for research into general AI.
This was prevalent in the 1970's, when advances in theorem proving methods, notably Robinson's resolution and further developements of that method, stimulated a great deal of optimism.
When these methods failed to deliver the advances sought there was a parting of ways between the AI community and the theorem proving community, and formal methods, the desire to formally verify computer systems software and hardware, became the dominant driver of research into the automation of formal deductive proof, and a more modest expectation for how much machines could be expected to achieve was reflected in the development of interactive proof tools intended to enable human beings with machine assistance to tackle the larger problems perceived as beyond the reach of complete proof automation.

This kind of _formal_ problem then became less significant in AI research, which became more concerned, for example, with perceptual problems, and, even for AI `logicists' such as McCarthy, with replicating common sense reasoning rather than formal mathematical reasoning or its applications to science and engineering.

The `deductive intelligence' which is the concern of this project is not aimed at common sense reasoning or at the solution of everyday problems.
It is concered with strictly formal reasoning applied in a priori sciences such as mathematics and software programming, and in empirical sciences and engineering, through the use of logical and mathematical models of the physical systems about which reasoning is required.
This kind of reasoning is intended ultimately to automate or partially automate engineering design, and the solution of other real-world problems through automated deduction using mathematical models.

The desire is to provide an architecture which can be used to advance this kind of formal modelling in default of machine intelligence in much the same way as it is conducted at present using interactive theorem provers with a patchwork of proof automation capabilities, but whicn provides a context in which more powerful machine intelligence can contribute as it evolves, and which is conducive to that evolution.

Certain features of the intended architecture can be touched upon here (and expanded later in the architectural exposition) as intended to facilitate and exploit deductive intelligence.
