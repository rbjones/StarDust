The deductive cloud is a repository for knowledge about logic, mathematics, and about the physical world we inhabit, in suitable form for rigorous deductive reasoning by intelligent artefacts.

To devise an architecture for such a system, to explain that architecture and give grounds for the supposition that the architecture will deliver the desired capabilities, and will be trustworthy, can only be done in the context of a philosophical position which embraces metaphysics, logic, philosophy of language, epistemology, science and more.
The enterprise depends upon, and potentially disrupts, very many branches of philosophy.
To devise an architecture which coherently embraces all those things which potentially fall under the scope of our deductive cloud and the synthetic intelligence we seek in it, requires a broad philosophical synthesis, but for a philosophy to provide a stable base for the enterprise it must be simple and solid.
I therefore believe that the kind of minimalistic philosophy belonging to the positivistic tradition is likely to serve best, and will seek to articulate such a system.
