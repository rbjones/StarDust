A natural basis for a minimalistic philosophy oriented towards formal science, engineering and technology is the positivistic tradition, particulalry in its most recent manifestation in the philosophy of Rudolf Carnap.
The philosophy outlined here can therefore be considered a moderate 21st Century Neo-positivism.
