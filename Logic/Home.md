# **The DA-Hol Wiki**

DA-Hol is intended to become a decentralised project developing open-source Decentralised Autonomous Higher Order Logic deduction-as-a-service applications.
This application depends upon an open architecture for globally distributed large scale mathematically precise and logically coherent knowledge representation (as abstract models).

The wiki at this stage consists only of a ["Manifesto"](The DAâ€‘Hol Manifesto), under development.

Throughout the wiki you will find stubs in the form of text in square brackets eventually to be linked to another page.
