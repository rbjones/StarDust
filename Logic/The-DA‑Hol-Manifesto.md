Deductive reason is ubiquitous.
No matter what the subject matter, deductive reasoning will be possible, and provides a reliable way of establishing new conclusions from established premises.

Many very important forms of non-deductive reasoning can be reduced to deductive reasoning in the context of models capturing accepted empirical knowledge.
Given a precise specification of requirement, and good models of the available means, the design of artefacts meeting those requirements by the given means can in principle be accomplished by purely deductive inference.
