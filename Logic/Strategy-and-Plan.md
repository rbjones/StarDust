Strategy is as yet embryonic.

There is an organisational strategy and a technical strategy.

##Â The Organisational Strategy

- The project starts as a wiki in a github repo
- Once sufficiently advanced, create room at Gitter, and post to hol-info to seek feedback and hope for collaborators
- If collaborators appear, draft and debate informal constitution for project  
otherwise continue solo without constitution
- Formalise Constitution
- Set up autonomous entity governed by the formal constitution

## The Technical Strategy

The technical strategy is essentially _architecture_ then _intelligence_ then _application_.
The aim is to move to an intelligent deductive capability in a good architectural context at the earliest possible moment, oriented to relatively simple applications which can drive the early economics and drive work into the learning process.
While I do want to see a sound and well-documented philosophical and logical basis, I don't want this to delay getting a practical grip on the technologies involved, so I am hoping that some kinds of prototyping activities will be undertaken from the very beginning.

- First of all, build the story, the big picture, in the wiki
- Second, work out some detail (possibly have to step outside the wiki for the more detailed parts) turning the sketch into an architecture, and then into draft standards for key elements.
