# StarDust [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/StarDust)

This repository is one of a group which I have created in a bid for cosmic mindspace, and provides a name for the whole, a brief overview and a place for anything which does not properly belong in any of the subsidiary projects.
Here belong the most extravagent ambitions to which the not exactly conservative components contribute.

We may begin by thinking of this as a STEM fantasy, but though fantastic, my commitment to progressing its realisation is pretty solid (if not my ability to do it alone).
The main danger to its completion is that someone else will get there before me, and I will have to rethink my objectives in the context that such success would create.
Not that there is any definite endpoint to the progression entailed.
Such success would only interfere with the early stages and leave a continuation replete with continuing challenges.

The StartDust repo seeks to articulate the highest level conception of the aims and methods of the project.
This gives way to more fundamental philosophical and architectural thinking for which the SynEpis repository is the place, so called because my conception of the depest philosophical foundations for this project is epistemological, and the kind of epistemology involved is more akin to the earliest and most abstract stages in the design of cognitive systems than it is to the more traditional philosophical approach to philosophy which regards knowledge as a given which it is the business of philosophy to enquire into and cast light upon.
That conception of epistemology I call _synthetic_ epistemology, and it stretches into the earliest aspects of architectural design of the knowledge repositories and cognitive systems which the project aims to construct.

There are then three repos into which main substance of the work is divided, roughly along simplistic lines corresponding to divisions articulated in the philosophy of David Hume, in his two "forks".
One such fork is the distinction between "ought" and "is", or between descriptive and evaluative propositions.
The other is the distinction among descriptive propositions between those expressing `_relations between ideas_' and `_matters of fact_', which distinguishes logical from empirical truths.
Having divide just one component of the first fork once more, we have declarative language broken in to three parts which differ in both the kinds of substance which they express, and the ways in which such their truth might be established.
This leads to three further subprojects, the first concerned with logical truths, the second with empirical truths and the last with values, priorities, purposes and ambitions.
Each of those subprojects is focussed on a potential _singularity_ broadly in the sense of science fiction authors such as Verner Vinge, insofar as it is intended that each introduces a new kind of self comprehension and re-invention to advance their primary capability.
It is intended that these aspects of their capability be a focal point upon which the development will lean to secure most rapid advancement in all the capabilities envisaged.
These points of potential singularity are also difficult bootstrap problems, the classic conception of singularity in artificial intelligence is predicated on the achievement of intelligence, without which one presumes that the systems in question will not be capable of designing intelligent artifacts.
Making these bootstrap problems as simple as possible is a tactic which will be adopted to facilitate the progression of these potential singularities.
Another strategic imperative is to adopt methods analogous to those of Google Deepmind's Alpha-zero and derivatives, which enable intelligence to be achieved in appropriate domains (perfect information) without the need of large amounts of data.

In the following very brief intros, I try to identify those aspects which potentially engender singularity, on which futher speculative detail may be found in the project descriptions to which links are provided.

## [SynEpis](https://rbjones.github.io/SynEpis) [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/SynEpis) 

Synthetic Epistemology, primarily concerned with the representation of knowledge, and with the case for the adoption of a single underlying abstract logical system for that purpose.
This addresses the structure of declarative sentences, the organisation of those sentences into the contexts in which such sentences have meaning, and the means whereby the truth of such sentences may be established.
These considerations are influenced in their character by the requirements of the subprojects which depend upon such capabilities, thus the architecture of a knowledge repository must accomodate the ambition that there it support a cosmically distributed repository independent of concrete representation and capable of merging with repositories developed by distributed intelligent systems originating from remote parts of the cosmos.

The realisation of these capabilities begins with HoLoTruth.

## [HoloTruth](https://rbjones.github.io/HoLoTruth) [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoTruth) 

HoloTruth is concerned with what Hume referred to as "relations between ideas", but which I will more often describe as _a priori_, (broadly)_logical_, or _analytic_ propositions, i.e. the kinds of truth which can be demonstrated to very high levels of confidence in formal deductive systems such as HOL.

The starting point for the conception of this technology is the LCF paradigm in which the inferences rules of the logical system are coded as algorithms which from theorems which are the premises of an inference compute the conclusions of the relevant inference rule.
However, this conception is broadened into a conception of `proof by correct computation' paradigm, in which any metatheoretic algorith which can be proven to be logically sound (i.e. deriving only provable theorems when given similar inputs) can be executed directly to contribute to a proof.
This perception gives rise to a potential singularity insofar as the system becomes capable of re-programming itself into more efficient ways of deriving theorems (which


The second prong of this fork is:

## [HoLoMod](https://rbjones.github.io/HoLoMod) [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoTruth)

which concerns Hume's "matter of fact", not so clear a notion, by which we understand objective empirical truths.
The interpretation of this domain of contingent rather than necessary truth which is progressed in this sub-project reflects, in ways which Hume did not anticipate, Hume's skepticism about what can properly be inferred from the sensory evidence upon which they are based.
In this part of the project we consider how mathematical models of the physical world can be constructed using the infrastructure provided by **DA-Hol**, how these are related to the sense data, coming in the future primarily from IOT online sensors, and how reasoning using these models about how to achieve the aims articulated or derived from **DA-Value** leads through activators, which may be IOT devices, to the implementation of desired transformations in the material universe.

## [HoLoVal](https://rbjones.github.io/HoLoVal) [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoVal)

HoLoVal covers the evaluative propositions, and generally the kind of thing which Aristotle would have classified as _practical science_.
Ethics, Politics, Economics.
How to decide, articulate and effect our morals and preferences, individually and collectively.
