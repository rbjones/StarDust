# StarDust [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/StarDust)

This repository is one of a group which I have created in a bid for cosmic mindspace, and provides a name for the whole, a brief overview and a place for anything which does not properly belong in any of the subsidiary projects.
Here belong the most extravagent ambitions to which the not exactly conservative components contribute.

We may begin by thinking of this as a STEM fantasy, but though fantastic, my commitment to progressing its realisation is pretty solid (if not my ability to do it alone).
The main danger to its completion is that someone else will get there before me, and I will have to rethink my objectives in the context that such success would create.
Not that there is any definite endpoint to the progression entailed, such success would only interfere with the early stages and leave a continuation replete with continuing challenges.

The StartDust repo seeks to articulate the highest level conception of the aims and methods of the project.
This gives way to more fundamental philosophical and architectural thinking for which the SynEpis repository is the place, so called because my conception of the depest philosophical foundations for this project is epistemological, and the kind of epistemology involved is more akin to the earliest and most abstract stages in the design of cognitive systems than it is to the more traditional philosophical approach to philosophy which regards knowledge as a given which it is the business of philosophy to enquire into and cast light upon.
That conception of epistemology I call _synthetic_ epistemology, and it stretches into the earliest aspects of architectural design of the knowledge repositories and cognitive systems which the project aims to construct.

There are then three repos into which main substance of the work is divided, roughly along simplistic lines corresponding to divisions articulated in the philosophy of David Hume, in his two "forks".
One such fork is the distinction between "ought" and "is", or between descriptive and evaluative propositions.
The other is the distinction among descriptive propositions between those expressing `_relations between ideas_' and matters of fact, which distinguishes logical from empirical truths.
Having divide just one component of the first fork once more, we have declarative language broken in to three parts which differ in both the kinds of substance which they express, and the ways in which such their truth might be established.
This leads to three furthersubprojects, the first concerned with logical truths, the second with empirical truths and the last with values, priorities, purposes and ambitions.

## [SynEpis](https://rbjones.github.io/SynEpis) [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/SynEpis) 

Synthetic Epistemology, primarily concerned with the representation of knowledge, and with the case for the adoption of a single underluing abstract logical system for that purpose.

## [HoloTruth](https://rbjones.github.io/HoLoTruth) [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoTruth) 

HoloTruth is concerned with what Hume referred to as "relations between ideas", but which I will more often describe as _a priori_, (broadly)_logical_, or _analytic_ propositions, i.e. the kinds of truth which can be demonstrated to very high levels of confidence in formal deductive systems such as HOL.

The second prong of this fork is:

## [HoLoMod](https://rbjones.github.io/HoLoMod) [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoTruth)

which concerns Hume's "matter of fact", not so clear a notion, by which we understand objective empirical truths.
The interpretation of this domain of contingent rather than necessary truth which is progressed in this sub-project reflects, in ways which Hume did not anticipate, Hume's skepticism about what can properly be inferred from the sensory evidence upon which they are based.
In this part of the project we consider how mathematical models of the physical world can be constructed using the infrastructure provided by **DA-Hol**, how these are related to the sense data, coming in the future primarily from IOT online sensors, and how reasoning using these models about how to achieve the aims articulated or derived from **DA-Value** leads through activators, which may be IOT devices, to the implementation of desired transformations in the material universe.

## [HoLoVal](https://rbjones.github.io/HoLoVal) [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoVal)

HoLoVal covers the evaluative propositions, and generally the kind of thing which Aristotle would have classified as _practical science_.
Ethics, Politics, Economics.
How to decide, articulate and effect our morals and preferences, individually and collectively.
