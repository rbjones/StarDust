Welcome to the HoLoMod wiki!

The HoLoMod project is a star of the [StarDust](https://github.com/rbjones/StarDust/wiki) constellation.

It is concerned with the use of Higher Order Logic for the construction and application of formal models of the word, i.e. in formal science, engineering, and other real world applications where deductive reasoning may be beneficial.
This includes how such models may be connected to the real world, for example via data obtained from or sent to IOT sensors and actuators.
