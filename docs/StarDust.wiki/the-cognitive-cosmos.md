- **cosmic hybrid deductive hyper-intelligence**  -  a short explanation of the terms
    * cosmic  
      think of this a single entity growing outwards across a large part of the milky way, approaching 100,000 light years across
    * hybrid  
      just as the brain is not homogeneous having a large cortex and various more central structures, this cosmic intelligence has an expanding out region spreading rapidly out across the galaxy, and probably inanimate, wrapped around smaller regions with intelligent living species present only in more slowly growing inner regions.
The intellectual power of the our regions is there only to progress the agenda evolved into the inner regions, capable of stunning independent intellectual accomplishments.
    * deductive  
       our project is primarily concerned with formal knowledge representation, deductive reasoning, hard science and its engineering applications, and more generally in the intelligent application of deduction to facilitate all aspects of human enterprise
    * hyper-intelligent  
       we are thinking here well beyond "the singularity" if this is construed as the point at which artificial intelligence surpasses that of homo sapiens, which might well happen this century, whereas we consider timescales of hundreds of thousands of years, justifying an expectation of hyper-intelligence.
