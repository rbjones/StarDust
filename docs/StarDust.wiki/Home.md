StarDust is a small constellation of projects concerned with the automation of deductive reason and its applications.

They are at present wiki-only projects, intended to sketch an architecture for our future cosmically distributed cognitive system.

There is one overarching project, [StarDust](StarDust), together with three subsidiary projects focussing on different aspect of the architecture:

- [Language, Truth and Proof](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoTruth/wiki)
- [Models and Contracts](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoMod/wiki)
- [Values and Objectives](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoVal/wiki)
