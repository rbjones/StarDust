## The Architecture

The proposed cognitive cosmos may be thought of as formed in three layers.

Beneath this top level the enterprise is structured into three layers, which correspond to different kinds of knowledge, with correspondingly different ways of establishing and exploiting knowledge.
Its best to describe these from the bottom up, and we give here only the briefest descriptions with links to the separate wiki for each layer.

- [HoLoTruth](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoTruth/wiki) The most fundamental layer in this structure is concerned with knowledge _a priori_, by which is meant knowledge, such as that of logic and mathematics, which tells us nothing about, and therefore can be established and used without reference to the state of the observable physical world.

- [HoLoMod](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoMod/wiki) The next layer is concerned with knowledge _a posteriori_, i.e. obtained from observations of and experiments in the physical world around us.
This includes formal accounts of hard science, and engineering and many other matters, and it formalisation is through logical or mathematical models of the physical world.
This layer depends upon the _a priori_ knowledge developed in the lower _a priori_ level.

- [HoLoVal](https://github.com/rbjones/HoLoVal/wiki)  The final layer goes beyond descriptive knowledge and is concerned with values, morals, with our choices about what kind of world we want to live in and the ways in which we can realise those choices.

- [StarDust](https://github.com/rbjones/StarDust/wiki) is the uppermost layer in this stack and one way of thinking about this is that it goes beyond the particular ideals we have that belong to _DA-Value_.
Technology, and the automation which it delivers, provides quality of life, and it is plausible that at some stage (probably not in the near future, but likely long before the time periods we consider in _StarDust_) a good synthesis of the diverse values of each of us in a pluralistic society will give high levels of fulfilment of the aspirations of all of us.
There is one great aspiration common to humankind, perhaps to life in general, which goes beyond personal fulfilment, and that is to explore and expand outwards.
It is the trajectory of this goal which goes beyond the scope of _DA-Value_ which is the subject matter of _StarDust_.
