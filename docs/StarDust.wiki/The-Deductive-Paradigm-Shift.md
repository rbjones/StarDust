To engage with it you must first of all contemplate the possibility of a major paradigm shift in information processing, from _computation_ to _inference_, taking place on a global scale.
In the context of that _possibility_, the aim of this project is to position _Higher Order Logic_ (HOL), and more specifically that particular formulation of HOL which has its roots in Russell and Church and was formulated by Mike Gordon, as a universal foundation enabling this paradigm shift. What it means to call HOL a "universal foundation", and the grounds for supposing it so, are not our present concern, but will be addressed later in the _philosophical_ underpinnings of the proposal.

Computer support for formal deduction has now been under development for more than half a century, and the use of these methods continues to be, in most application domains, highly labour intensive.
Its extensive use with currently available technologies is improbable.
Its use, even by that group of academics who have been most concerned with logical proofs, those conducting research in pure mathematics, has been very limited indeed.
The paradigm shift I anticipate is therefore predicated on substantial advances in the deductive capabilities of machine intelligence, and the architecture proposed aims (inter alia) to provide an incubator for that kind of machine intelligence.

I am not myself an expert in machine intelligence, and in believing that this is the moment for a project which anticipates and provides a home for deductive machine intelligence I am not claiming that I have any special recipe for its attainment (though several aspects of this proposal are designed with that in mind).
It is the present state, rate of advancement and scale of commitment to machine intelligence (independently of anything which might take place under this project) that gives me belief that progress of machine intelligence in this special yet general domain, not yet conspicuous, may be soon upon us.

Of the various factors contributing to this present state, it is advances in specialised hardware which may be the most important:
- by bringing machines up to a level of performance in "deep learning" which yields effective commercial and industrial applications
- in promising rapid further reductions in the cost of training, as specialised hardware performance achieves a better-than-Moore's-law improvement trajectory

Commercial applications of deep learning are now so pervasive that no organisation can afford to ignore them for fear of disruption by competitors who do not.
This commercial imperative is fuelling the advances in hardware which will continue to multiply the domains of effective application.

Nevertheless, those working on the automation of proof are likely to look at the achievements of deep learning and be skeptical about whether they come anywhere near delivering in machines the kind of intelligence which we see in mathematicians, and which may be thought prerequisite for the mooted paradigm shift.
We see many examples of the kind of intuitive pattern-matching capabilities, such as sound and image recognition, which were not thought of as requiring intelligence at all until AI research showed how hard they were to mechanise.
Their present realisation may be thought due rather to the scale of raw compute now available than to the (undoubted) sophistication of the algorithms now available.

There are however, examples which fall outside this pattern and which may provide a model for some not-so-distant achievement in deductive intelligence.
Well known among these is the AlphaGo system.
This champion Go player is an application of deep neural nets.
But these deep neural nets provide heuristics which guide the trajectory and evaluate positions in a forward search which is itself programmed rather than realised by learning in a neural net.
Thus we obtain an intelligence which comes closer to reasoning about the problems it addresses than many applications of deep learning, and an approach which seems potentially adaptable to deductive applications.

Further elaboration of the ambition which inspires this project is presented in four parts, which are related to the structure of knowledge and the machinery for its exploitation, considering firstly the logico-mathematical machinery with which we construct scientific models of the world about us and the detailed engineering models which support technology development and industrial and commercial applications.
Mechanisms for incubation of deductive intelligence are mooted, and the ways in which this deductive intelligence, together with data from sensors and other oracular sources feed inference processes enabling deductive `smart contracts' and other varieties of deductive business process automation.
