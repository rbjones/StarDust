### The Singularity

I probably am not a singularitarian, but I may be not so far removed.
So its useful in giving a sketch of my own conception of the future into which _StarDust_ is intended to play, to say something about why I am not quite a singularitarian.

The most common definition of "the technological singularity" is the point at which "an artificial intelligence" has been created which is more intelligent than human beings and capable of designing an even more intelligent artefact.
It is then supposed that this causes an explosive increase in the rate of technological progress.

I do believe that artificial intelligence will come.
But I don't think it will come, by design.
I don't think of it as being an independent intelligence in the way that we tend to think of human beings.
And I don't think the intelligence will be progressed by the intelligence designing some even greater intelligence.

So I do have fairly comprehensive objections at least to the terms in which this phenomenon is described.

But I think that what I do believe, is almost as radical, and differs mostly in fairly obvious ways.

Vinge, who coined the term "technological singularity", clearly believed that human intelligence was continually being amplified by the technology we are developing, long before any of that technology could be considered intelligent itself.
