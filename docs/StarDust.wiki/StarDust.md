StarDust is an architecture for cosmic intelligence, structured in three parts which may be thought of as forming an architectural stack.
The architecture is under development in a set of four github repositories (one for the whole, and one for each of the principal parts).
Its high level description is provided in wikis associated with those repos.

Beneath this level the repositories will contain more detailed designs, prototypes and implementations of key features of the architecture.
The _hybrid intelligent cognitive cosmos_ described by this project would grow around these key features over an extended period of time.

This project is very much about _artificial intelligence_ but the architecture proposed is _hybrid_, involving both organic and inorganic parts, and in the course of its realisation it is expected that evolution by design will make the distinction between _natural_ and _artificial_ untenable.
It is therefore an architecture which speaks of various capabilities or functions but is intended to be entirely agnostic as to whether each capability is delivered by man, machine or cyborg.
The viability of the architecture does not depend upon there being any intelligent artefacts, and the realisation of artificial intelligence within this architectural framework is not limited by the architecture to any single implementation paradigm. 

It is just this top level StarDust repo which is _cosmic_, i.e. which considers the long term physically extended future of intelligent cognition and its expansion across the cosmos.
The lower three layers of the stack are more pedestrian in addressing developments intended to take place in shorter timescales.

The StarDust wiki falls into three main parts, one indulging in this cosmic fantasy, another describing in a less speculative way the structuring of the cognition into three three architectural layers, and the last addressing strategy for refining and implementing the ideas.
All matters peculiar to one of those layers will then be addressed in the wiki (or chapter) for that layer.

The cosmic speculations prominent here are a fantasy, which I hope can be given credence by much more concrete technical proposals on the details of the lowest layer of the the architecture, which is a small step forward from systems already in use.

- **[The Ambition](The-Ambition)**  
We propose an architectural framework capable of supporting the development of an integrated hybrid intelligence coextensive with the reach of humanity through the cosmos.

- **[The Architecture](The-Architecture)**  
The proposed architecture is a stack of three layers.
The lowest is pure logic, the next supports descriptive formal models, their establishment from sensory inputs and their application in effecting change through actuators, and the highest in developing value systems and deploying these in choice of courses of action to be effected by the lower layers.

- **[The Strategy](The-Strategy)**
The strategy addresses both technical matters pertinent to realisation of the ambition and organisational and financial considerations essential to implementation and proliferation.
