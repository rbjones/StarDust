Before considering the question whether logical deduction could be placed centre stage in an all encompassing "Intelligent Deductive Web" you may want to know why anyone would want to do that.
Surely this idea smacks of GOFAI (Good Old Fashioned AI) and is put forward at a time when AI as Deep Learning in Neural Nets is rapidly taking over the world.

Neural nets don't do deduction, of course they could, but its not one of their fortes.
They do consume huge computational resources.
So to talk, as I am here, of a paradigm shift away from computation toward deduction seems to be flying in the face of progress.

However, deduction does not exclude computation, computation is one of the methods which are used in proof.
What a deductive paradigm does is to add an extra layer of meaning, so that the significance of the computations is known, and their effective exploitation can be more completely automated.

An important (some might say the most important) feature of the use of Deep Learning is the shift from programming a computer to solve a problem, to the computer learning for itself how to solve the problem.
The use of deductive logic allows us to combine this kind of un-programmed functionality with high levels of trust.

Its worth looking at how this works.

Consider the application of deep learning in medicine.
Powerful computers using deep learning can assimilate enormous volumes of medical knowledge and use this to good effect in suggesting diagnoses and offering references to pertinent literature.
To be effective and valuable, such a system does not need to be highly reliable.
It makes suggestions and provides information, a qualified and experienced medical consultant will make the decisions.
The machine suggests solutions, the consultant validates the suggestions.

There is a general recipe here for achieving both high performance and high levels of trust, which is particularly valuable in problem domains where validation can be undertaken automatically.
Mathematics is an example of such a domain.
Mathematicians can guess general mathematical theorems using their deep knowledge of the particular mathematical subject matter, but often their guesses will prove to be mistaken.
Deductive proof has been adopted as a method of ensuring the truth of mathematical hypotheses before they accepted into the body of accepted theory.
The nice thing about proofs is that they are an effective check for the truth of a theorem, and the correctness of a proof is itself either mechanically checkable (in the case of a formal proof) or at least, substantially easier and more reliably checked than unsupported hypotheses.

Thus, by combining deep learning with logical deduction we have the prospect of combining intelligence and high degrees of reliability, in a context in which problems are solved without programming.

Lets consider an example far away from mathematics in which the combination of un-programmed functionality and high levels of trust is important.
Consider the construction of a smart building as the Internet-of-Things advances.
Let suppose that the building has been designed in detail be a firm of architects, and a contract is placed with a construction company to supply a building to that specification.
The design incorporates a variety of sensors throughout the building which will be essential to the efficient operation of the completed building, but will also continuously supply data about the progress of the construction.

The contract includes a detailed schedule of the stages in the construction, when they should be completed, and what payments are due on completion.
Using data from the sensors (supplemented by reports from inspectors), the deductive cloud continuously monitors the progress of the construction, and will automatically deduce completion of a stage when all the necessary compliance conditions have been met.
It may then report compliance to a smart contract running on some blockchain which triggers payment to the contractor.
There is no need here to write algorithms to determine compliance with the requirements for each stage of the contract, this will be undertaken deductively from the detailed terms of the contract.

The deductive involvement can be pushed back further.
Once the detailed architectural design is in place, there is a planning activity which plays into the details of the construction contract.
This planning activity an itself be undertaken deductively working from the detailed design.

Pushing yet further back, if the detailed architecture is preceded by a careful formulation of the key requirements which the building must satisfy, intelligent deduction can validate that the proposed design will meet those requirements, and might provide support to the architects in the design process, or even largely automate the design, so that the role of the architects becomes one of requirements specification, perhaps being more involved in the aesthetic aspects of the design.
