### Universal Fulfilment

The idea is that everyone should be able to realise their own _true potential_, and that in the future, with the automation of the means of producing physical and intellectual goods, this will be almost completely realisable.
The main limits in the realisation of universal fulfilment will be incompatibilities between the needs and desires of different individuals or groups.

Not everyone will see this goal as sufficient, or even desirable.
Putting aside for the moment those who doubt its desirability, and addressing those who consider it insufficient, their own desire for more (than universal fulfilment) will form a part of the notion of universal fulfilment (assuming their fulfilment depended upon it), and their greater ambitions will therefore be incorporated into the apparently lesser goal.

Thus, knowing that there will be many who would not feel personally fulfilled as a contributing member of a society with no greater ambition than its own well-being, we also consider as incorporated in this aim the attainment and progression of great questions like "what's it all about? Why are we here?".
