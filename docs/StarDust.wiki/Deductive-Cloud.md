The idea presented here as the _Deductive Cloud_ is analogous to the W3C "Semantic Web" but strictly formal and deductive.

As I understand it, the motivation of the "Semantic Web" is to enable web search which is sensitive to meanings, not confined to seeking syntactic features of web documents.
The Semantic Web initiative sought to realise this by defining special markup languages which could be used to annotate web documents giving information about their content.
This is nn enabler for _intelligent_ search, an application of machine intelligence, and one imagines it as working primarily in the realm of _common sense_, in the way in which a human being might search the web, but rather more rapidly.

DA-Hol counterposes and aims to provide infrastructure for intelligent deductive inference (which encompasses search) in a strictly formal context, and it is this strictly formal counterpart to the semantic web which is called here the "Deductive Cloud".

There are two main faces to this.

- The formalisation of science, engineering, and other domains of knowledge, by manual encoding of the relevant theories as formal models.  
It should be noted here that the proposal is that empirical theories are introduced in much the same manner as mathematical ones, by conservative extension, aka definition.
The theories are not asserted, they are just defined.
When applied, a definition is given using these defined scientific terms of some hypothetical (or actual, it makes no difference) physical situation, and theorems are derived which establish, for example, whether that system satisfies some specification of how it is intended to behave.
All this is purely mathematical, no claim about the physical world is made, but results are obtained which can be interpreted as conditional observations about the physical world.
