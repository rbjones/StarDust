### Hype Cycles

I like to think, even speculate, about "the big picture" and DA-Hol is one big part of an even bigger story I am painting.
In this I connect DA-Hol with some ideas which may be thought now near a peak of un-realistic expectation.
I think here of _Deep Learning_, at present the most celebrated face of machine intelligence, and "the blockchain", enabling technology for cypto-currencies and now touted as central to a complete transformation of financial services, property transactions and business processes more generally.

I'd like here to say a few words about my own assessment of these technologies, how great their potential contribution to DA-Hol might be, and to what extent my belief in the merits of this proposal depends upon the soundness of these connected ideas.
This might help the reader form an opinion about how well grounded this proposal is, and just how far into the clouds my head protrudes.

#### Deep Learning and Machine Intelligence

I have a long standing conviction that genuine machine intelligence will eventually come, and by that I mean that machines will eventually be able to attain the levels of proficiency in constructing rigorous proofs of difficult mathematical theorems that we associate with the best professional mathematicians.
I also doubt that mathematicians will make much use of proof technology until machine intelligence approaches that point, though possibly new generations of mathematicians might turn out more positively inclined to the technology.

I have watched from a distance several great hype-cycles in AI, when expectations have been raised by some new achievement which in the end has proved more limited than it first seemed.

Do I think "Deep Learning" yet another hype-cycle, or has the problem now been cracked?

Well I don't have any doubt that Deep Learning is delivering commercially valuable capabilities, that a worthwhile number of the present avalanche of applications will pay off.
Are we anywhere near achieving the kind of machine intelligence which would be needed for a significant impact on the automation of deductive reasoning?
I don't see it yet.
But I do see a model in the AlphaGo project, for a way of using deep learning which might well pay off in interactive or automatic theorem proving, a combination of deep learning and forward search.
Presumably, a pure neural net solution could accomplish this kind of effect, for we humans do it that way, but that's not how the Deep Mind team did it, and its probably not the way theorem proving will be cracked.

So you may see here, that with some reservations I am optimistic about the prospects for applications of deep learning in theorem proving.
However, the project I propose here does not entirely depend on success in machine intelligence.
I do think that the range and scale of application which I think in terms of does depend on it, but that the architecture I outline will be valuable before such advances are secured, and it is intended to provide an environment conducive for the evolution of intelligent deductive automation.

#### BlockChain and Smart Contracts

My enthusiasm for blockchain technologies is much more heavily qualified, and these qualifications need to be spelled out.
