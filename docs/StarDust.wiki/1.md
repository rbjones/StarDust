# The StarDust Constellation

The StarDust Constellation is a small group of "projects" based in Github repositories.

They are concerned with [_hybrid deductive intelligence_](1.1.1) and its applications.

High-level descriptions of the constellation and its members are provided in hypertext wikis associated with each of the four repositories, which are organised so as to combine into a printable PDF.
This general pattern is to present 

- the aims of the project or subproject
- the philosophy underpinning the proposed approach (using the term philosophy here broadly)
- the architecture of the proposed solution
- the strategy for refining and implementing the architecture

This StarDust repo provides the highest level view, gives a first indication of the role of the other three sub-projects and how they fit together, and addresses issues which do not naturally fit into any one of those sub-projects.

At its highest level, Stardust is intended to be a substantial enterprise, independently of the three sub-projects, primarily as a philosophical exercise in "Cognitive Architecture".
