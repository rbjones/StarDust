## The Ambition

[The Cognitive Cosmos](The-Cognitive-Cosmos)

The ambition here is broad.

- [The Deductive Paradigm Shift](The-Deductive-Paradigm-Shift)  
To understand the proposal you must first engaged with the idea of a major paradigm shift in the way that computers process information.
- [Formal Mathematics] (Formal-Mathematics)  
The formalisation and automation of deductive mathematics
(encompassing and extending the principal aims of QED and Calculemus)
- [Deductive Cloud](Deductive-Cloud)
Not just mathematics, but science, engineering and technology can be formalised as mathematical models in Higher Order Logic.
Our knowledge of the world can be rendered in mathematics and made more amenable to rigorous deduction than it would otherwise be, a "semantic web" in abstract HOL (with diverse concrete presentations)
- [General Deductive Intelligence](General-Deductive-Intelligence)
Our architecture is intended to provide a suitable context for collaboration between man and machine, each learning from the other, learning and evolving in a competitive autonomous marketplace
- [Deductive Smart Contracts]  
Deductive proof delivers trustworthy results, and the proposed architecture delivers graduated levels of confidence depending on how trustworthy the various premises and deductive agents involved in the proof are.
This may be of value in business processes even where the complexity of reasoning falls well below that required in mathematical research.
We now see an impetus for the automation of business processes through so-called "smart contracts" and believe that declarative languages presenting models in abstract HOL may be advantageous in these applications.

Its not envisages that all of this would be happening under this one project.
Think in terms of a core and an ecosystem.
The sketch above is of the principal parts of the whole.
Anything sufficiently substantial and self contained will become a subproject, or a related project.
DA-Hol will begin as rhetoric, graduate through architectural exposition and high level design, detailed design of key standards and then prototype and further develop key components.

For further detail on how this breaks down, follow the links (only present once they have gone blue) to the four sub-topics and then see the architectural sketch in this manifesto, after perusing the philosophical underpinnings.
