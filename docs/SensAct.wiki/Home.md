Welcome to the SensAct wiki!

The SensAct project is a star of the [StarDust](https://github.com/rbjones/StarDust/wiki) constellation.

It is concerned with the transition from sensory data to empirical model, with the use of such models to formulate action plans, and with the way in which such plans can be effected through actuators.
