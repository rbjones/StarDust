# The DA-Hol Wiki

This DA-Hol project aims to exploit Higher Order Logic (HOL) as an abstract _lingua franca_ of the kind of _intelligent hybrid cognitive cosmos_ envisaged in the StarDust constellation, of which it is a part.
DA-Hol is the centrepiece of the transition from computation to inference proposed in StarDust, and provides the technology for establishing a distributed body of abstract logical truths (here referred to as HoLo-truths, an abbreviation of Higher Order LOgical truth).

It is envisaged that the present paradigm for interactive theorem proving on locally complete logical structures be evolved into support for reasoning in and contributing to globally distributed contexts, and that proof itself become a distributed collaboration between intelligent meat and machine in a marketplace which provides an incubator for deductive intelligence.
