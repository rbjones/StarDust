## Strategy and Plan

Strategy is as yet embryonic.

There is an [organisational strategy](#The-Organisational-Strategy) and a [technical strategy](#the-technical-strategy).

### The Organisational Strategy

The organisation needs and opportunities depend on how many other creative developers decide to contribute to the project.
So long as its just me, organisation is almost a non-problem, but even then since the architecture is intended to support (and even depend upon) autonomous deductive agents, there are "organisational" problems about how that should be done (even if only one human, still, any number of machines).

The scale of the ambition is not strictly compatible with that outcome, however likely it might be.
It would then be a contribution to architectural thinking about this important topic, together with some prototyping of key features of the proposal.

Like most open-source development, no formal organisation would be strictly necessary even with a substantial number of collaborators.
However, since this is designed to be a contribution to a digital economy, the economic ideas need to be explored and prototyped just as much as the purely deductive aspects, so even with a small number of collaborators I would be hoping to explore formal constitutions with a view to building a digital constitution suitable for automation, under whose auspices "Deduction as a Service" would be prototyped. 

The crypto-digital-economy is a moving target, so ideas about how this project fits into it are fluid, but the organisational strategy is to evolve the organisation to intercept what seems, as the architecture is filled out and prototyped, to be the most effective way of delivering the benefits promised by the architecture.

### The Technical Strategy

The technical strategy is essentially _architecture_ then _intelligence_ then _application_.
But of course, it is essential that the earlier stages are exposed to feedback from prototyping and implementing the later stages.

I did set out hoping to complete a manifesto first, and then move on to design and prototyping, but of course that's not going to happen.
The manifesto and the follow-up in more detailed architecture and design, will be strung out over a longer time period than I would like, while work also begins on prototyping key elements of the architecture.

The aim is to move to an intelligent deductive capability in a good architectural context at the earliest possible moment, oriented to relatively simple applications which can drive the early economics and drive work into the learning process.
While I do want to see a sound and well-documented philosophical and logical basis, I don't want this to delay getting a practical grip on the technologies involved, so I am hoping that some kinds of prototyping activities will be undertaken from the very beginning.

- First of all, build the story, the big picture, in the wiki
- Second, work out some detail (possibly have to step outside the wiki for the more detailed parts) turning the sketch into an architecture, and then into successive levels of design for key elements.
