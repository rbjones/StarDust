This "Epistemological Synthesis" provides the philosophical underpinnings for the StarDust constellation, a STEM fantasy about a future cosmically distributed hybrid  (meat and machine) cognitive system built upon a cosmically distributed repository of knowledge, integrated through a universal abstract logical system the character of which is the subject of this epistemological synthesis.
Other members of the StarDust constellation are more directly concerned with the development of software (and ultimately hardware) to realise that fantasy.
This Epistemological Synthesis addresses the more philosophical aspects of all other parts of the constellation, and hence in its gross structure reflects the structure of the whole StarDust constellation, insofar as it is understood at any stage in its development.

As presently conceived, those other parts of the project are:

### [HoLoTruth](HoloTruth),

supporting the a priori sciences,

### [HoloMod](HoLoMod),

addressing empirical science, and real world applications in technology, engineering and commerce with particular concern for the establishment of empirical truths facilitating the use of "smart contracts" through the certification of the outcomes which establish contractual compliance at each stage in such a contract.

### and [HoLoVal](HoLoVal),

concerned with the values and purposes which determine what outcomes are desirable and which purposes should be pursued.
This includes the means to express values and ensure the coherence of systems of values, and the ways in which purposes can be evaluated relative to those value systems.
It will also address the problems arising in collaboration with agents whose value syetems do not wholly align, both in terms of effecting dialogue to minimise dissonance and locating areas of consonance and opportunities for collaboration in matters relating to common values.
One purpose which receives particular attention is the proliferation if intelligent systems across the cosmos, which is presented as an evolutionary imperative for which moderation according to diverse value systems is a desideratum.
